    	It's time to start on the homeward journey by way of a few nights in Singapore. 
    	Travelling <a href="https://www.britishairways.com/en-gb/information/travel-classes/first/first" target="_blank">BA First Class</a> will certainly help.
    	<br />
    	Our trip today is in two stages. The first leg takes us to Sydney airport and from there we connect for the flight to Singapore.
    	Total journey time is 18 hours including a few hours enjoying the First Class lounge at Sydney.

    	The airport terminal is just across the road from the Novotel. Once we've checked in our bags through to Singapore we can grab some breakfast either at the hotel or in the lounge - or both.
    	<br />
    	Our first flight today is BA7418/QF142 departing for Sydney at 0835. Flight time is 3 hours 40 minutes. We're in Business Class seats 2A/2C where more breakfast will be served.
    	<br />
    	On arrival into Sydney at 1015 we make our way through flight connections to the famous and well-regarded <a href="https://www.qantas.com/travel/airlines/lounge-locations/sydney/international-t1/international-first-lounge/global/en" target="_blank">Qantas First Class Lounge</a>.
    	We'll have a few hours to enjoy here. Spa treatment, food & drink are all available while we relax in comfort.
