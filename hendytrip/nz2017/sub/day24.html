    	Singapore lies some 85 miles north of the equator. It's hot and humid all year round although slightly less so at the time we'll be visiting.
    	Expect daytime temperatures in the mid to high 20s while overnight it'll still be over 20C.
    	<br />
    	December sees the start of the monsoon season in this part of the world so expect to see a fair bit of rain. Luckily the sun can also be expected for an average of 6 hours each day.
    	So pack a brolly.

    	This will be the first of three days to have a look at Singapore so the plan is to make it a pretty relaxing stay.
    	<br />
    	Getting around should be simple enough given the reputation of the <a href="https://www.smrt.com.sg/" target="_blank">MRT</a>. 
    	Probably worth investing in the <a href="http://thesingaporetouristpass.com.sg/" target="_blank">Tourist Pass</a> to make train and bus hopping nice and easy.

		Our hotel is situated overlooking the bustling area of <a href="http://www.clarkequay.com.sg/en/" target="_blank">Clarke Quay</a> which houses restaurants, bars and so on alongside
		Singapore River. Quite touristy I suppose but plenty to do by day or night.
		<br />
		<a href="http://www.chinatown.sg/" target="_blank">Chinatown</a> is also a short stroll away.
