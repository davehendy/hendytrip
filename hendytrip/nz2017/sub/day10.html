    	Christchurch, otherwise known as The Garden City, suffered badly in the earthquakes of 2010/11 but is slowly being rebuilt.
    	Expect temperatures in the high teens with perhaps more chance of rain than sun in November.

    	Sunday opening is quite widespread so today might best be spent wandering around Christchurch.
    	There's an area called Woolston which was named after its namesake in Southampton so it'd be nice to wander over and enjoy a beer.
