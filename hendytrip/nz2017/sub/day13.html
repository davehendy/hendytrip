    	The day is weather dependent. Hopefully all will be ok once we've called <a href="http://www.airmilford.co.nz/" target="_blank">Air Milford</a> 
    	at 0645 for us to set off on our trip to Milford Sound. If the weather is bad then the trip could well be rearranged for the following day.

		We're due to depart from Queenstown Airport at 0800. This will entail a 35 minute flight across the mountains to Milford Sound,
    	followed up with 1 hour 45 minutes cruising the fiord while taking a complimentary hot breakfast.
    	After that it'll be another 35 minute scenic journey back to Queenstown in good time for a lunchtime beer or two.
    	The trip is described <a href="http://www.airmilford.co.nz/milford-sound-flights/fly-milford-sound-cruise-fly.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

   	 	If we're not going to engage in the local fascination with bungyee jumping we can probably find some exercise in the local bars.
   	 	<a href="http://smithscraftbeer.co.nz/" target="_blank">Smith's Craft Beer House</a> has Mountain Hot Wings and plenty of beer to help cool down.
   	 	The <a href="http://atlasbeercafe.com/" target="_blank">Atlas Beer Cafe</a> also offers a fine range while close by
   	 	<a href="http://www.publickitchen.co.nz/" target="_blank">Public Kitchen and Bar</a> looks to have a good beer selection.
   	 	Another is <a href="http://pubonwharf.co.nz/" target="_blank">Pub on Wharf</a>.
