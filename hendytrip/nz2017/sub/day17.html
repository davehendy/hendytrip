    	A leisurely breakfast before setting off on the road for the last time.
    	Much of the trip to Picton is on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_State_Highway_63" target="_blank">State Highway 63</a>. This is normally a quiet back road but
    	since the recent earthquake blocked Highway 1 north of Christchurch this is now part of the major detour. Hopefully the repairs to Highway 1 will be complete by the time of our trip
    	but we'll need to keep an eye on this in case we need to allow more time.

    	We'll drop the car off at the Picton Ferry terminal before boarding the <a href="https://www.interislander.co.nz/" target="_blank">Interislander Ferry</a> destined for Wellington on the North Island.
