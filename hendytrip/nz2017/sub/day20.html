    	The first of two and a half days in Auckland. This time of year is reputed to be sunny and pleasant with temperatures up to 20C.
    	<br />
    	New Zealand's largest city is built on 50 volcanos and not all of them are extinct, although the last eruption was 600 years ago.
    	<br />
		Any tall building invites an ascent and in this case the <a href="https://www.skycityauckland.co.nz/attractions/sky-tower/" target="_blank">Sky Tower</a> awaits us.
