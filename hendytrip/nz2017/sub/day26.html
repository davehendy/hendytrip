    	Our last day away. A few more hours in Singapore before we head off	home in the evening.
    	Hotel checkout is at midday but we can store our bags until ready to make our way to the 
    	<a href="http://www.changiairport.com/" target="_blank">airport</a> in the late afternoon.
    	<br />
    	BA have a <a href="https://www.oneworld.com/ffp/lounge-access/-/loungeaccess/SIN/797" target="_blank">First Class lounge</a> waiting for us to relax in before
    	we board our Airbus A380 for the overnight journey back to Heathrow.

		We leave Singapore at 2315 on BA12. It's an overnight flight in darkness all the way so this time we won't bother with window seats.
		Instead we have an inner pair of First Class seats 03E/03F which can be made up into comfy beds for plenty of sleep during the 14 hour flight.
		See the link below for a picture of the seats.
