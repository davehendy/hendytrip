    	Our flight to Christchurch was going to leave Sydney in the morning but it's now been changed to the evening.
    	Hotel checkout time is 1600 so I'd suggest a leisurely breakfast, a final stroll around Sydney and then a taxi or train to the airport where we can relax in the

    	No need to rush though so maybe we could try the <a href="https://www.airportlink.com.au/" target="_blank">Airport Link train</a>. This schedule change is a real pain in the arse but Intercontinental Ambassador membership allows for a late check out and that helps.

    	The flight is Business Class on QF139/BA7423 <a href="http://www.qantas.com/travel/airlines/trans-tasman-business-class/global/en" target="_blank">Qantas Jetconnect</a> and departs at 1845. We have seats 2D/2F and will be served food on board.

    	Flight time to Christchurch is 3 hours and 10 minutes and is scheduled to arrive at 2355 local time which is 11 hours ahead of the UK.
    	<br />
    	Once through immigration we pick up our Avis car. They know what flight we're on so they should have the car ready for us. Nothing fancy, just something like a Toyota Corolla hatchback that'll do us for a week or so.

    	We're staying in the centre of Christchurch at 
    	<a href="http://fino.nz/" target="_blank">Fino Hotel & Suites</a>. We have a one bedroom deluxe suite which even comes with a washing machine.
    	With the flight schedule change it'll likely be 0100 or later by the time our heads hit the pillow. Such is the life of jet-setters, eh?
