    	A relaxing day ahead as we head for Auckland aboard the <a href="http://www.kiwirailscenic.co.nz/northern-explorer/" target="_blank">KiwiRail Northern Explorer</a> scenic train.
    	It's a short walk from the hotel to Wellington railway station where we need to check in our luggage by 0730 for a 0755 departure. Breakfast can be eaten beforehand at the hotel
    	or we may prefer to eat on board where there's plenty of food and drink available.
    	<br />
    	This is a 423 mile journey along pretty much the whole of the NZ North Island. All sorts of scenery will be available, from coastline to bush to volcanos.
		Arrival into Auckland is scheduled to be at 1845. Once there it'll be a short taxi trip to our accommodation.
