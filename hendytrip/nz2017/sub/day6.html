    	Our flight arrives in Sydney at 0945 local time which is 9 hours ahead of the UK. 
    	Immigration procedures shouldn't take too long and when that's done we'll hop in a taxi and head for the hotel.

		We're staying at the <a href="https://www.icsydney.com.au/" target="_blank">InterContinental</a> close to Circular Quay.
		Officially check in isn't until 1500 but we can flash our Ambassador membership and hopefully access our room before that.
		If we're too early the hotel will take care of our luggage while we wander off for a first look at Sydney. I suspect a beer will be in order.	
		<br />Our room has been upgraded to a King Deluxe Harbour Suite overlooking the Opera House & bridge.
