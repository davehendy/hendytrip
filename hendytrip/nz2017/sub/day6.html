    	Our flight arrives in Sydney at 0935 local time which is 11 hours ahead of the UK. 
    	Immigration procedures shouldn't take too long and when that's done we've got a choice. 
    	Either use the <a href="https://www.airportlink.com.au/" target="_blank">Airport Link Train</a> to Circular Quay station which is close to the hotel or
    	just get a cab.

		We're staying at the <a href="https://www.icsydney.com.au/" target="_blank">InterContinental</a> close to Circular Quay.
		Officially check in isn't until 1500 but we can flash our Ambassador membership and hopefully access our room before that.
		If we're too early the hotel will take care of our luggage while we wander off for a first look at Sydney. I suspect a beer will be in order.	
		<br />Our room has been upgraded to a King Deluxe Harbour Suite overlooking the Opera House & Harbour Bridge.
