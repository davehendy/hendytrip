    	The last full day in New Zealand and now it's time to think of the homeward journey which begins early tomorrow. 
    	We'll check out from our apartment by 1100, storing our luggage at reception before heading out for a spot of lunch and a last look at Auckland.
    	<br />
    	At some time during the afternoon we'll make our way to our Superior room at the <a href="http://www.novotel.com/gb/hotel-7485-novotel-auckland-airport/index.shtml" target="_blank">Novotel</a> at 
    	<a href="https://www.aucklandairport.co.nz/" target="_blank">Auckland airport</a> for a relaxing evening prior to our early start in the morning.
    	Either take the <a href="https://www.skybus.co.nz/" target="_blank">SkyBus</a> from close to the hotel or just get a cab to the airport.
		<br />
		After cocktails & dinner it'll be off to bed in good time for an early start in the morning.
